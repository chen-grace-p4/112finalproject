Other Cat: Oh... you live the same kind of life huh. 
Other Cat: What kind of food do you even eat to become that kind of color?
Hey, I'm not "that kind" of color. Blue is pretty! 
I eat like squirrel, mice, rabbits, and even fish sometimes.
Other Cat: Really?? How could we eat the same things but look so different?
