Well the cats here are pretty nice and they live the same kind of life blue cats do.
Old Cat: That's preposterous! I've heard how brutal you blue cats were, torturing prey before eating them.
No, no! You've got it all wrong. We kill the prey immediately after catching them just like you cats do!
Where do you get these wild stories from?
Old Cat: Hmph, I don't believe you.
