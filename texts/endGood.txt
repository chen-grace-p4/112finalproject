Finally, I'm back home! 
...
Why'd the door behind me disappear? I wanted to go back! 
In fact, I was going to tell all my friends to visit the red village with me so they can see red cats and things aren't that bad after all.
Well, I'm still going to tell them that even though we can't go visit the red village anymore.
I made a lot of new friends that I can't talk to anymore but it was still cool!
