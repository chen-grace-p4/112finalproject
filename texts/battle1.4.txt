Hey, you're not so bad actually. I'm getting used to the reddish color now.
Other Cat: Yeah, you're not as bad as I thought you were. 
Other Cat: So why are you in this place?
I just went through some weird door and came here. I want to go back home actually!
Other Cat: Oh no! I feel bad now.
Other Cat: Hey that reminds me, I found this weird piece of wood that's the same color of you this morning.
Other Cat: You want it?
Yeah!! Maybe if I find more pieces I could go home!
*You took the blue piece of wood*
