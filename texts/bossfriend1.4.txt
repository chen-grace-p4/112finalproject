Well, what else am I supposed to do? I've insisted I'm a nice cat just like you are!
Old Cat: You think I'm a nice cat? I've only been suspicious of you so far.
Yeah but I can see you're probably just blinded by these beliefs you've believed in for so long.
You are pretty old after all and maybe your mind isn't too flexible anymore.
Old Cat: Hmph! I'm more lively than I look. 
Old Cat: Well... Maybe you aren't so bad after all.
