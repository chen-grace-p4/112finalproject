Name: Cat-Tales
Description: You play as a blue cat in a blue world that goes into a red world with red cats. 
You have to interact with red cats to find pieces of a blue door so you can eventually go back home. 
At the end, you encounter a final boss and then go back to the blue world.

How to run: go to starter.py and run it like any other python file in VSCode (Ctrl + B). 
To play, use arrow keys to move around, X to speed up text, and Z to interact/select things.

No libraries that need to be installed.

Shortcut Commands:
On the start screen/splash screen: 
pressing 'g', 'b', or 'n' will jump to after you have found all necessary pieces to progress to the boss/the end. 
'g' will give you the 'good ending' where you become friends with everyone. 
'b' will give you the 'bad ending' where you killed all/most of the red cats. 
'n' will give you the 'neutral ending' where you kill/befriend some cats.
You still need to fight the final boss during these but you skipped having to fight 7 cats beforehand.

During a battle (the black and white screen): 
Pressing 't' will jump to the end of the battle as if you had befriended the cat by talking to it 5 times. 
Pressing 'f' will jump to the end of the batle as if you had killed the cat by attacking until its health became 0.
